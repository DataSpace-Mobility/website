The lack of a robust data culture in India’s urban mobility sector acts as a constraint in the development of sound government policies, efficient service delivery and most importantly, innovation from the private sector and startups across the country.

For instance, Akash’s fledgling drone start-up is incubated at an Atal Incubator in the city of Ahmedabad. Every time he flies his drone, Akash is able to capture innumerable data points about the city’s roads - the state of traffic at the busiest junctions, the location of every illegally parked car and even images of road accidents as they occur. There’s no doubt that the data he collects is of immense value to the city administration, the police, emergency services and even other startups operating in the region. Therefore, the question we asked ourselves was this - Is there a way to connect them to each other and help them innovate together?

We aim to build Mobility DataSpace, a unified data ecosystem for urban mobility, that will enable democratic sharing of standardized, high quality urban mobility-related datasets among various stakeholders in the quadruple helix model - Government, citizens, academia, and industry. Further, through sustained dialogue and collaboration with these stakeholders, we hope to incentivise a “culture of data” within urban mobility and allied sectors. 

Inspired by the DataSmart Cities Strategy and MeitY’s framework for National Open Digital Ecosystems, Mobility DataSpace will rest on three key pillars - Data Delivery Platform, Governance and Community. The Data Delivery Platform will act as public digital infrastructure that can share standardized, high quality data, as well as provide additional services based on the available data. Through the second pillar, Governance, we aim to clearly define the types of data licensing and rules of usage for this platform along with responsibilities and liabilities of various actors within the ecosystem. Finally, the third and most important pillar, Community, will focus on facilitating collaboration and innovation among government organisations, private companies, start-ups, research institutions. 

The Beta version of Mobility DataSpace is currently hosted on http://ckan.dataspace.mobi and our team can be reached at hi@dataspace.mobi.
