**Data Challenge platform:** https://upperwal.github.io/data-challenge

With less than a week to accomplish this demanding task, we set out to explore the datasets on the AMPLIFI portal. As urban mobility was our area of study for the India Smart Cities Fellowship, we decided to build a sectoral dashboard to monitor, assess and plan for mobility in Indian cities. From our initial review of the AMPLIFI portal, we realised that only 27 datasets were listed under the mobility sector. Moreover, these datasets contained a considerable number of missing data points and invalid entries. With just a few days to go for the submission deadline, the lack of a robust dataset for urban mobility seemed like an insurmountable challenge for our team. Unsure of our next steps, we returned to the drawing board and looked for ways to overcome this setback. 

### Connecting the dots

With our thinking caps on and over several cups of hot chai, we spent the next two days brainstorming for out-of-the-box ideas to create a robust and holistic urban mobility dashboard. We realised that, for a comprehensive analysis of the urban mobility sector, it was imperative to include datasets from other sectors on the AMPLIFI portal and generate cross-sectoral insights. Therefore, before we could analyse the data and design the dashboard, it was essential to pre-process all the datasets available on the AMPLIFI portal. We carried out a series of operations to remove anomalies and outliers from the data apart from extracting numerical data points from the strings. Following this, we applied statistical normalisation techniques to bring the various features to the same scale. Additionally, we also filled in some of the missing data using simple interpolation techniques. 

Next, we spent an entire day reviewing all pre-processed datasets and identifying meaningful insights that could be inferred from the data. After long hours of discussion, we shortlisted just over 75 datasets from a diverse range of sectors linked to mobility that could be used to generate insights on three themes - ‘City on the Move’, ‘City for All’ and ‘Watchful City’.

The first theme, ‘City on the Move’ focussed on the interlinkages between urban mobility, public health and air pollution. Infrastructure availability for active mobility through cycling and walking was gauged through data points on length of footpaths and cycle tracks in each of the cities.  The same data on footpaths and cycle tracks was also correlated to the average annual health expenditure per household to understand whether opportunities for an active lifestyle led to significant savings in health expenditure. Finally, we correlated the infrastructure availability with air pollution levels in each city to ascertain if additional infrastructure for active mobility led to a decrease in air pollution and fossil fuel consumption.

Through the second theme, ‘City for All’, we tried to compare the affordability and availability of public transport across the cities. By correlating datasets on average total daily ridership on public buses and average annual household consumption expenditure in each city, we attempted to compare the affordability of public transport for the average urban citizen. Further, with the correlation of datasets on total seats in public transport buses and total number of people residing in slums, we tried to generate insights on public transport supply for low income groups in the city.

Finally, the last theme, ‘Watchful City’, focussed on two datasets related to road safety - road accidents and street light coverage. We calculated the street light coverage in the city with the help of datasets on road length provided with streetlights and total road length. Further, using the datasets on total fatalities recorded due to road accidents and total number of death registrations in the city, we were able to calculate the percentage of deaths that occured due to road accidents. 

### Building the dashboard

Once the numbers were crunched, we regrouped to brainstorm on the look and feel of the dashboard. We realised that our potential audience, made up of city administrators, urban development practitioners, transport industry professionals, start-ups and everyday citizens, was incredibly diverse in terms of their ability to understand the results of complex statistical analysis and their awareness about the working of urban transport systems. Therefore, in order to effectively convey the valuable insights generated from our extensive data analysis to the most number of people, it was essential to make the dashboard as lucid and succinct as possible. 

We chose to present the entire dashboard in an interactive dialogue format with intriguing questions setting the context for each of the themes. For instance, the first theme of ‘City on the Move’ was introduced with the question - “Is your city built for active mobility?”. Next, a personalised storyline was woven around each city’s performance on various indicators within the three themes. For example, we calculated that Bhopal’s cycle tracks covered merely 34% of the roads in the city. Therefore, we coded the dashboard to display a customised message for the city - “There’s quite a way to go, Bhopal! You’ve achieved Level of Service 3 as per the national benchmarks for cycle track infrastructure”. To add some humor to the dashboard, we included custom error messages for when data was missing or when the analysis resulted in impossible results. For instance, due to the lack of data for Ahmedabad’s fossil fuel consumption, the dashboard displays the tongue-in-cheek message, “Maybe Ahmedabad has started using teleportation!”

Once we had developed the preliminary version of the dashboard, we felt that we were still missing one final piece of the puzzle. While the dashboard successfully presented unique insights and comparative analyses, it missed out on the opportunity to nudge users towards the best course of action to improve their city’s performance. Therefore, along with the customised messages on a city’s performance, we decided to add excerpts as well as links to significant policy papers and government guidelines that would help the city prepare a roadmap for the future. 

After a long weekend of meticulous data analysis and website design, we were ready to present Pravega, the sectoral dashboard on urban mobility to the jury and our peers. We chose to make the code for the dashboard open source in order to encourage collaboration and co-creation on subsequent versions. Pravega is presently hosted at https://upperwal.github.io/data-challenge/#/. In the future, we hope that Pravega provides an opportunity for data-driven decision making while also building trust through transparency and accountability. 

The AMPLIFI Urban Data Challenge reinforced the need to break down academic silos and work together in order to solve complex problems. It pushed us to think creatively while also teaching us to ground our ideas in what could be realistically achieved within a limited timeframe. Despite our project not being chosen for the final shortlist, building Pravega made us realise that when we worked together as a team, the creative possibilities were nothing short of infinite!
