#### EV charging stations facilities mapping 

Implementation of electric vehicles in India is vital to reduce pollution levels and move forward to a decarbonised future in mobility. In order to achieve so, the transition for the users must be as seamless as possible to encourage the adoption of EVs. With the aggregation of data from different stakeholders, drivers will be able to find in real-time the most convenient charging station for their car. Even simpler than going to a petrol pump!!

#### Social distancing on the metro 

Social distancing is the new normal. With the aim of ensuring safe commutes for all, aggregated data in Mobility DataSpace can help to develop crowd management solutions. For service providers, this can provide tools to schedule trains accordingly and enforce social distancing in the premises. At the same time, commuters can make informed decisions on when and how to travel.  

#### Public transport accessibility mapping - PwD

Mobility for people with disabilities is a daily challenge. Real-time status informing about the accessibility conditions of the different transport modes can be a real life-changer. With standardized data shared at Mobility DataSpace, commuters with disabilities will be able to commute in an easier manner.  

#### Real traffic layer and travel behaviour 

Urban traffic congestion is not only a daily headache, it directly decreases the productivity, quality of life and economic growth of Indian cities. Mobility DataSpace will collate real-time standardized data from the different modes of transport, with which commuting times can be drastically reduced by the implementation of innovative solutions. 

#### Urban freight movement

Door-step delivery of goods is an increasing trend in congested Indian cities due to convenience and more recently, safety. On the other hand, this trend considerably increases traffic on the already congested roads. By digesting the data stored at Mobility DataSpace, urban freight movement can be optimised and goods can be  delivered in a more “smart” manner. 

#### NMT infrastructure planning

Adoption of a more sustainable approach for urban mobility in India is much needed. With the current and future disruptions and restrictions on public transport, Non-Motorized Transport alternatives can be easily adopted. The only constraint to achieve so far is the lack of appropriate infrastructure. With the data shared at Mobility DataSpace, data-led NMT infrastructure improvement and planning can be enabled. 

#### Road accidents with drone surveys

In road accidents, rapid response can be the difference between life or death. Precious seconds are commonly lost by emergency services due to road congestion. With the real-time data flowing through Mobility DataSpace, the status and characteristics of the accident can be known beforehand and measures taken accordingly. 

#### Real-time parking

Did you ever spend more time looking for a parking spot than actually arriving at the destination? With the power of aggregated data, you will be able to utilise your commuting time to actually move (amazing isn't it?). This is achievable by developing innovative solutions to map in real-time availability of spots and even book them in advance for your peace of mind. 

#### Multi-modal trip planning

Last and first-mile connectivity along with complicated interchanges between modes of transport are the major reasons why urban Indians prefer to have their own way of transport. A seamless origin-to-destination commute can be offered to citizens via a multi-modal integrated trip planner. The aggregated real-time data from the diverse modes of transport in the ecosystem can be directly digested from Mobility DataSpace to achieve it. 

#### Concluding statement 

Now that we have shared a glimpse of what is achievable with the data shared at Mobility DataSpace, it is your task to continue exploring the universe of possibilities with the aim of improving Indian Urban Mobility.  We will be more than pleased to discuss your use case ideas and future possibilities of collaboration at hi@dataspace.mobi .
